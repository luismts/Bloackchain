# Bloackchain
Here I'll keep all the documentation about Blockchain that can be useful for me and others.

## So, what's next?

Wanna learn BlockChain? Cool! Keep in mind that Data professionals were the group most likely to view Blockchain as revolutionary. This makes sense, especially in the context of 2018’s anxiety around data. With Blockchain, data  is more secure; distributed ledgers give you greater visibility on where data has come from, when it was gathered. This is good news from both an analytics and a trust perspective. 

Expert Insight: [**Imran Bashir – The Blockchain Revolution**]()

Packt author Imran Bashir shares his thoughts on Blockchain technology and what it means to modern 
developers. 

*I agree with the Skill Up respondents that Blockchain will be revolutionary. The fundamental issue that blockchain 
solves is that of trust. It enables two or more mutually distrusting parties to transact with each other without 
the need of establishing trust and a trusted third party. This phenomenon alone is enough to start a revolution. 
This paradigm fundamentally changes the way we conduct business and results in significant improvements such as cost saving, security and transparency.*

*Any developer should learn blockchain technology because in the next year or so there will be a high demand for skilled blockchain developers/engineers. Even now there are many unfilled jobs: it is said that there are 14 jobs open for every 
Blockchain developer.*

*Blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric are the most commonly used for development. As such, developers should focus on at least one of these platforms.*

In case you don't know there are several paths you can follow in the BloackChain world.

Some of them are:

- Smart Contract
- Wallet 
- BitCoin / Ethereum
- Peer to Peer Network
- DApps

## Practice

It's a good idea to do some exercises after learning the basics.
